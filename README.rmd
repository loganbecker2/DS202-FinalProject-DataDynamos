## View Data Set
```{r, message = FALSE}
#install.packages("readr")
library(readr)
# Use your file name (copy path)
injury_data <- read_csv("./archive.zip")
injury_data
```

## Filter Data to be all years beyond (inclusive) 2010 
```{r, message=FALSE}
filtered_injurydata <- injury_data[as.numeric(format(injury_data$Date, "%Y")) >= 2010,]
summary(filtered_injurydata$Date)
```

## Change old team names to their new team name
```{r, message=FALSE}
all_teams <- (unique(filtered_injurydata$Team))
all_teams
# We see there is 32 teams here, there should only be 30 nba teams. Bullets and Bobcats are old names, let's change those to be correct
# Hornets <- Bobcats
# Wizards <- Bullets

filtered_injurydata$Team <- 
  ifelse(filtered_injurydata$Team == "Bobcats", "Hornets",
  ifelse(filtered_injurydata$Team == "Bullets", "Wizards",
         filtered_injurydata$Team))
# Check if there is now 30 teams
all_teams <- (unique(filtered_injurydata$Team))
all_teams
# Data is ready now
```

## Let's look at the highest injured teams
```{r, message=FALSE}
team_counts <- table(filtered_injurydata$Team)
sorted_team_counts <- sort(team_counts, decreasing = TRUE)
highest5_injuredTeams <- head(sorted_team_counts, 5)
highest5_injuredTeams
```
The most frequently injured team are Spurs (1110), Celtics (1028), Raptors (1009), Mavericks (958), Heat (901).
